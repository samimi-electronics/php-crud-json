# Simple PHP Crud project using JSON
The webserver is Apache and the code is PHP.
I used a ```docker-compose``` file to scaffold the PHP application.
I didn't use the MySQL database, I just followed a tutorial online on how to
setup a PHP docker project with MySQL.
This is my first proper attempt on how to setup a basic CRUD application with PHP.

I will work on adding MySQL with PDO after finishing this project.
As I'm a NodeJS developer, I feel that doing this first is a good step
towards learning how to program in PHP.

Granted, it is a bit awkward working with PHP after programming in JavaScript for
which is now almost a year!

## How to run the project
Simply open a terminal in the ```docker``` folder and run:
```
    docker-compose up
```
then open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080
